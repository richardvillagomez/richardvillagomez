# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Richard!
<br /> 

<!--Start Intro-->               
I am an undergraduate student studying Data Science and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. My academic journey is fueled by a passion for integrating data science & machine learning, software engineering, and user-experience design into impactful solutions. As a Pacific Islander in these fields, I aim to lead data-driven projects focused on sustainable development and social impact here and across the Pacific. Beyond my academics and research, I am dedicated to finding innovative ways to make data science education accessible to everyone.

I'm always looking to connect! Feel free to email me at richard.villagomez@berkeley.edu for collaboration opportunities.
